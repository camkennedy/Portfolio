# Cameron's Portfolio of Public Projects
This repository showcases some of the more interesting technical projects I've developed that can be shared publicly, highlighting data science and analytics solutions to business problems.

## About the Author
Cameron is a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, pursuing his Masters in Information and Data Science (MIDS) degree. With 20 years of experience in a wide variety of roles and industries including healthcare, financial services, management consulting, and mining, using analytics to solve business problems has been a central theme in his career.

# Summary of Projects

| Project Description | Outcomes | Key Technologies / Methods |
|:-|:-|:-|
|[**Russian Troll Tweet Prediction**](https://github.com/camkennedy/Portfolio/tree/master/RussianTweetPrediction)<br>Natural language processing project to identify Russian political troll-bots on Twitter in the 2016 US election. The technical highlight was concatenating tweet metadata to the LSTM output, then piping the combined data through additional neural network layers.|<ul><li>99% accuracy</li><li>Increased accuracy from 96% baseline using LSTM alone.</li><li>[Research report with complete findings](https://github.com/camkennedy/Portfolio/blob/master/RussianTweetPrediction/Project%20Final%20Paper.pdf)</li></ul>|<ul><li>LSTM Neural Network</li><li>TensorFlow</li><li>Python</li><li>SQL</li></ul>|
|[**Predicting Customer Churn for a Subscription Music Service**](https://github.com/camkennedy/Portfolio/tree/master/MusicServiceChurn)<br>This analysis uses machine learning to predict customer churn for a large music subscription serivce.|<ul><li>97% accuracy</li><li>78% recall</li><li>Economic model to optimze spending amount by customer to prevent churn</li></ul>|<ul><li>XGBoost (best results; Random Forest, SVM, and other models used too)</li><li>Scikit-Learn</li><li>Python</li><li>SQL</li></ul>|

|[**R Data Summarization and Feature Extraction**](https://github.com/camkennedy/Portfolio/tree/master/R_FeatureExtraction)<br>This example creates multiple summaries of data from a large table using parameters from another (usually much smaller) table. It features a non-equi join, allowing summary data to be extracted efficiently from multiple, simultaneous conditions. This technique can then be used either to generate quick summaries of data, or in feature extraction as part of a larger machine learning exercise. It's not a project like the others on this list; instead, it's a code snippet I find very useful!|Efficient summarization of data without creating an interim table|<ul><li>R</li><li>data.table library</li><li>Non-equi join</li></ul>|
